			<h1>Crystals Collectors!</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
<p>There will be four rings with crystals displayed as buttons on the page. The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.</p>
<p>When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. The amount is hidden until the player clicks a crystal.</p> 
<p>When they do click one, update the player's score counter. The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.</p> 
<p>The player loses if their score goes above the random number. The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.</p> 
<p>When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. </p>
<p>The number of games the player wins and loses will be displayed. Please do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.</p>
